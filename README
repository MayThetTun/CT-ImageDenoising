% A PyTorch implementation of FFDNet image Denoising (Medical image Poisson-Gaussian Noise)
====================================================
## Dependencies
* [PyTorch v0.3.1](http://pytorch.org/)
* [scikit-image](http://scikit-image.org/)
* [torchvision](https://github.com/pytorch/vision)
* [OpenCV](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/)
* [HDF5](http://www.h5py.org/)
* [tensorboardX](https://github.com/lanpa/tensorboard-pytorch)

## Medical image denoising
======================================
(1) Create prepare patches

python prepare_patches.py --aug_times 1 --gray;

The default size of the stride is set to 20, while augmentation time can be chosen (with the default being 1).
Users have the flexibility to specify patch size, FFDNet recommends grayscale for 70.
A model can be trained after having built the training and validation databases.
(i.e. train_gray.h5* and val_gray.h5* for grayscale denoising).

(2) Model Training
=================
For Grayscale image,

python OrgTrain.py --epochs 50 --gray;

* By default, models are trained for values of gaussian noise in [0, 75], poisson noise [0, 20] and
* validation gaussian noise 25 and poisson noise is set to 10.
* We're able to modify the training and validation ranges. The training range for AWGN,
specified as [0, 75] following FFDNet, and others are designated as moderate noise levels as per relevant papers.

(3) Model Testing
==============
For Grayscale image,

python OrgTest.py --no_of_channel 1 --gnoise_sigma 25 --pnoise_sigma 10 --add_noise = true;

* Change the noise level according to the gaussian noise level  [ gnoise_sigma ] parameter and
* poisson noise level [ pnoise_sigma ] parameter.

** Modify the training and testing file names for DLPF, BLPF, GLPF, and SLPF to different requirements.
